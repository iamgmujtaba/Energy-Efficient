I have updated the PowerTuor application in eclipse. 

The original copy can be obtained from https://github.com/msg555/PowerTutor

This package includes the PowerTutor source code.  The code responsible for
uploading logs to our remote server has been removed and replaced by a stub that
does nothing.
